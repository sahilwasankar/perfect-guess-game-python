# Perfect Guess Game (Python)

A console-based Python number guessing game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

---

## 🎯 About the Project
In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.  
The player must guess the number, and the game provides feedback until the correct number is guessed.

The project is designed to practice clean OOP structure, input validation, and game logic.

## 🚀 Features
- Random number generation
- Input validation using try-except
- Feedback: Too high / Too low
- Attempt counter
- Replay functionality
- Clean OOP-based design

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Methods and `self`
- Loops and conditional statements
- Exception handling
- Modular code structure
